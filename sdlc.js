const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const Analysis = "This is the second step, goes over business rules, and data models."
const Design = "This is the third step, this step sets the peramiters for the design and code, it's the blueprint of the code."
const Implementation = "This is the fourth step, this step is where the coding takes place."
const testingIntergration = "This is the fifth step, this is where the project/ code is tested in QA and made public after passing QA testing"
const maintain = "This is the last step, In this step project/ code has been release. This is where the project/ code is maintained by fixing bugs that werent found in testing and updating software/ code"
